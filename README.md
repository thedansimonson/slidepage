# slidepage
Create webpages that can also function as slides. F11 and "baby, you've got a stew going."

## Features
* Create a page `slide_x.htm` to add the `x`th slide. (yes, if you want to insert, you gotta rename all the files. Never said this was perfect.)
* Built in Javascript forward and backward arrows to advance pages. 

## Examples

* A version of the example in this repo: http://www.discverb.com/slidepage_demo/
* A more complete set of slides: http://www.thedansimonson.com/langproc_overview/
